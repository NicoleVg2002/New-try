This is a list of my current fav songs

Papa Roach- Last Resort

Cut my life into pieces This is my last resort Suffocation, no breathing 
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding This is my last resort 
Cut my life into pieces I've reached my last resort Suffocation, no breathing 
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding Do you even care if I die bleeding? 
Would it be wrong, would it be right If I took my life tonight? 
Chances are that I might Mutilation out of sight 
And I'm contemplating suicide

Foo Figtherss- The pretender

Keep you in the dark You know they all pretend 
Keep you in the dark And so it all began 
Send in your skeletons Sing as their bones go marching in again 
They need you buried deep The secrets that you keep are ever ready 
Are you ready?

Depeche Mode- enjoy de silence

Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

The Smiths- ask me 

Shyness is nice, and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life you'd like to
Shyness is nice, and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life you'd like to
So if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say no, how could I?
