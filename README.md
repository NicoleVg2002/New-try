This is a list of my current fav songs

Papa Roach- Last Resort

Cut my life into pieces This is my last resort Suffocation, no breathing Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding This is my last resort Cut my life into pieces I've reached my last resort Suffocation, no breathing Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding Do you even care if I die bleeding? Would it be wrong, would it be right If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might Mutilation out of sight And I'm contemplating suicide

Foo Figtherss- The pretender

Keep you in the dark You know they all pretend Keep you in the dark And so it all began Send in your skeletons Sing as their bones go marching in again They need you buried deep The secrets that you keep are ever ready Are you ready?
